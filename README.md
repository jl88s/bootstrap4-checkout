### Starter Pack

I made this to optimize my productivity when developing anything.
<br />
Use the **Starter-Pack** before majority of the projects I start.


* It has **Gulp** - a task runner that automates different tasks
* It has **SASS/SCSS** - a preprocessor for CSS to speed up styling
* It has **Autoprefixer** - automatically creates vendor prefixes 
* It has **BrowserSync** - live streams changes through the browser
